#### Innovation Program Document Repository Management

Establish and maintain a centralized document repository for the innovation program. This ensures efficient, secure, and organized access to all critical information, templates, reports, and deliverables generated throughout the program lifecycle.

### Key Considerations:

1.  **Storage Platform Selection:**
	*   Select a secure, accessible, and scalable cloud storage platform (e.g., Google Drive, SharePoint, Dropbox) that aligns with organizational IT policies.
	*   Ensure the chosen platform complies with the organization's data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable).
1.  **Logical Folder Structure Definition:**
	*   Define a clear, intuitive, and standardized folder structure to facilitate easy navigation, storage, and retrieval of documents.
	*   Categorize documents by type (e.g., proposals, research, meeting minutes, financial_reports), by project phase, or by innitiative. Each innitiative must have its own dedicated folder within the repository. The folder name must follow this format: <innitiative id>, space, <innitiative name>. For example, `INN001 New line of phosphorescent t-shirts`.
  * Each time a new innitiative is approved, a subfolder will be created within the main 'initiatives' folder or equivalent.
  * Establish and enforce clear naming conventions for both documents and folders to ensure consistency and facilitate efficient search and identification.
1.  **Access Control Implementation:**
	*   Implement a robust, role-based access control (RBAC) system to ensure that only authorized individuals can access, modify, or share sensitive and confidential documents.
	*   The [[Innovation Sponsor]] and the [[Innovation Manager]] must have full administrative access to the entire repository.
	*   [[Innitiative Manager]]s must have edit access to their respective project folders and read-access to general program documents.
	*   Program participants and [[Innitiative Contributor]]s should have access tailored to the documents relevant to their specific roles and responsibilities (typically read-only for general docs, contribute for specific task docs).
4.  **Comprehensive Innovation Process Documentation:**
    *   Ensure that all documents and artifacts generated during the innovation process are systematically archived in the repository within the correct innitiative folder (e.g., market research findings, user personas, design sketches, wireframes, prototype test plans, user feedback summaries, validation reports, final presentations).
5.  **Data Backup and Recovery Strategy:**
    *   Implement an automated and regular data backup system to protect against accidental data loss, corruption, or system failures.
    *   Establish and document a disaster recovery process to ensure business continuity for the innovation program in case of an unexpected critical event.
6.  **Communication, Training, and Onboarding:**
    *   Clearly communicate to all program participants the existence, purpose, and location of the document repository, along with procedures for accessing and utilizing the information effectively.
    *   Provide adequate training and onboarding materials on naming conventions, folder structure, version control, and access control procedures to all users.

#### Opportunity Generation

Actively source and stimulate the creation of innovation opportunities using a diverse set of techniques. This involves looking both internally and externally for unmet needs, unsolved problems, and emerging trends that could lead to valuable innovations.

Apply various techniques for generating innovation opportunities to drive the identification of new ideas. These techniques aim to foster creative thinking and gather diverse perspectives.

### Steps for Opportunity Generation:

1.  **Select and Apply Idea Generation Techniques:**
	*   Employ a range of techniques suitable for the organizational context, such as:
		*   **Brainstorming Sessions:** Structured or unstructured group sessions to generate a high volume of ideas.
		*   **Design Thinking Workshops:** Empathetic, user-centered approaches to uncover needs and ideate solutions.
		*   **Employee Interviews & Suggestion Schemes:** Tapping into the knowledge and insights of frontline staff and other employees.
		*   **Co-creation with Stakeholders:** Collaborative sessions with customers, partners, or suppliers to generate shared-value opportunities.
		*   **Market and Technology Trend Analysis:** Scanning for emerging technologies, market shifts, and competitor actions.
		*   **Benchmarking:** Learning from best practices and innovations in other companies, both within and outside the industry.
		*   **Customer Journey Mapping:** Identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement from the customer's perspective.
2.  **Gather Diverse Information and Insights:**
	*   Collect relevant information from a multitude of sources:
		*   Internal data (sales figures, operational metrics, employee feedback).
		*   External market research data and industry reports.
		*   Direct customer feedback (surveys, interviews, support tickets).
		*   Academic research, scientific publications, and patent databases.
3.  **Analyze, Synthesize, and Identify Potential Opportunities:**
	*   Systematically analyze the collected information to identify patterns, connections, emerging trends, and recurring problems or unmet needs. Synthesize these findings into clearly articulated, concrete innovation opportunities.

### Recommended Tools and Techniques:

*   **iNNitiatives app:** Directly use the 'Opportunities' section in the iNNitiatives app to initially capture and document the raw outputs from generation activities before formal registration.
*   **Digital Whiteboards (Miro, Mural):** For virtual brainstorming and idea organization.
*   **Survey Tools (Typeform, Google Forms):** For collecting widespread feedback.

By following this process, the organization can build a rich pipeline of potential innovation opportunities, which then feed into the registration and evaluation stages.

#### Opportunity Registration

Formally document identified innovation opportunities in the 'Opportunities' section of the iNNitiatives app. This step ensures that each potential opportunity is captured consistently with essential details for preliminary assessment and tracking.

### Preliminary Evaluation during Registration
As part of the registration, perform an initial high-level assessment of opportunities based on apparent technical feasibility and broad strategic alignment to filter out clearly unviable suggestions early.

## Steps for Registration:
1. **Register the Opportunity**: Document the opportunity comprehensively in the 'Opportunities' section of the iNNitiatives app. Ensure to include:
   - `Opportunity - ID`: A unique identifier assigned (e.g., OPP-YYYY-NNN).
   - `Opportunity - Name`: A concise and descriptive title (e.g., "Automate Invoice Processing").
   - `Opportunity - Description`: A thorough explanation of the context, the problem or unmet need it addresses, and its potential impact or benefit.
   - `Opportunity - Proposer`: The name or team who identified/submitted the opportunity.
   - `Opportunity - Priority`: An initial, preliminary priority score (e.g., 0-9 scale) based on perceived urgency and strategic relevance.
2. **Conduct Preliminary Evaluation**: Briefly assess the opportunity against high-level criteria:
   - **Apparent Technical Feasibility**: Is the underlying technology or approach seemingly achievable with current or near-future capabilities?
   - **Broad Strategic Alignment**: Does the opportunity generally align with the company's overall strategic direction and innovation focus areas?
   - **Potential Impact (Qualitative)**: What is the initial sense of the potential benefits (e.g., cost savings, revenue growth, efficiency gains, improved customer satisfaction)?
3. **Assign Initial Priority**: Based on the preliminary evaluation, assign or adjust the initial priority. This helps in early-stage sorting.
4. **Ensure Field Completion**: Verify that all mandatory fields in the 'Opportunities' section of the iNNitiatives app are accurately and consistently filled for the new entry.

This structured registration process creates a valuable, queryable database of potential innovations, forming the basis for more detailed evaluation.

#### Opportunity Evaluation

Systematically assess registered opportunities against a defined set of criteria to determine their potential value, feasibility, and strategic fit. This step goes deeper than the preliminary evaluation during registration and is crucial for making informed decisions about which opportunities to advance into formal initiatives.

For each registered innovation opportunity:

1. **Detailed Evaluation**: Evaluate the opportunity more thoroughly based on:
   - **Technical Feasibility**: Can the proposed solution be developed and implemented with available or acquirable technology and expertise? What are the technical risks?
   - **Strategic Alignment**: How well does this opportunity align with the organization's specific strategic objectives, innovation goals, and market focus? Does it leverage core competencies?
   - **Potential Impact/Value**: Quantify or estimate the potential benefits. This could include financial returns (ROI, new revenue), operational improvements (cost reduction, efficiency), market advantages (market share, competitive differentiation), or social/environmental impact.
   - **Resource Requirements**: Estimate the likely resources needed (financial, human, technological, time).
   - **Risks and Challenges**: Identify potential risks (market, technical, financial, operational) and challenges to successful implementation.
   - **Market Attractiveness/Demand**: Is there a clear customer need or market demand for this? What is the size of the potential market?
2. **Assign/Refine Priority**: Based on the detailed evaluation, adjust or confirm the priority of the opportunity. This often involves a scoring model or a committee review. Consider factors like:
   - **Urgency**: How quickly is a solution needed to address the problem or capitalize on the opportunity?
   - **Strategic Importance**: How critical is this opportunity for achieving strategic goals?
   - **Benefit/Effort Ratio**: Compare the potential benefits against the estimated effort and resources required.
3. **Document Evaluation Outcomes**: Record the findings, scores, and rationale for the assigned priority in the 'Opportunities' section of the iNNitiatives app or a linked evaluation document. Ensure the information in the following fields is updated or confirmed:
   - `Opportunity - Priority`: Updated priority value.
   - Potentially add new fields for scoring against specific criteria (e.g., `Opportunity - Strategic Fit Score`, `Opportunity - Impact Score`).
   - Notes on key findings from the evaluation.
This process helps to create a prioritized backlog of opportunities, ready for selection to become formal 'Innitiatives'.

### Innitiative Management

The structured lifecycle management for a specific innovation idea that has been selected from the prioritized opportunities. This involves progressing the idea through stages of definition, concept design, prototype development, and validation to determine its viability for full-scale development or implementation.

The 'Innitiatives' section in the iNNitiatives app is where ideas that address particular opportunities are recorded and managed.

## Proceso
1.  **Identificar la Oportunidad**: Se parte de una oportunidad detectada previamente.
2.  **Brainstorming de Ideas**: Se generan ideas utilizando técnicas como SCAMPER o Design Thinking.
3.  **Registro Detallado**: Se registra cada iniciativa asignando un ID único y especificando:
    *   Nombre descriptivo.
    *   Oportunidad que aborda.
    *   Problema que soluciona.
    *   Notas relevantes.
4.  **Validación Interna**: Se valida la iniciativa con los stakeholders clave para asegurar la alineación.
5.  **Evaluación con Criterios Definidos**: Se evalúa usando criterios claros, como:
    *   Claridad en la definición del problema.
    *   Alineación con los stakeholders.
    *   Factibilidad de la solución propuesta.

Este proceso asegura que solo las iniciativas bien definidas y alineadas con los objetivos estratégicos sean consideradas para su desarrollo posterior.

#### Idea Definition

Transform a prioritized opportunity into a formal 'Innitiative' by clearly defining the problem it addresses, the target customer, and initial thoughts on potential solutions. This is recorded in the 'Innitiatives' section of the iNNitiatives app.

## Steps
1. **Select Prioritized Opportunity**: Choose a high-priority opportunity from the 'Opportunities' module to convert into an 'Innitiative'.
2. **Brainstorm & Refine Solution Ideas**: Based on the opportunity, conduct focused brainstorming (e.g., using SCAMPER, Design Thinking principles) to generate and refine specific solution ideas.
3. **Register Innitiative**: Document the new innitiative in the 'Innitiatives' section of the iNNitiatives app, populating key fields:
   - `Innitiative - ID`: Assign a unique identifier.
   - `Innitiative - Name`: A clear, descriptive name for the innitiative.
   - `Innitiative - Opportunity`: Link to the source `Opportunity - ID`.
   - `Innitiative - Problem`: Clearly articulate the specific problem this innitiative aims to solve, from the customer's perspective.
   - `Innitiative - Customer`: Define the primary target user or beneficiary.
   - `Innitiative - Notes`: Initial thoughts, scope considerations, or key assumptions.
4. **Internal Stakeholder Validation**: Briefly validate the problem definition and initial idea with key internal stakeholders (e.g., subject matter experts, potential internal users, sales/marketing for market fit) to ensure alignment and gather early feedback.
5. **Initial Feasibility & Viability Check**: Evaluate the defined idea against basic decision criteria: Is the problem clearly defined and significant? Is there stakeholder alignment? Does it appear broadly feasible at this early stage?

#### Prototype Development

Create a tangible, testable version (Minimum Viable Product - MVP, prototype, or experiment) of the concept to gather feedback and validate assumptions. Track experiments and progress using fields like `Innitiative - Next Steps`, `Innitiative - Resources`, and `Innitiative - Goals` (which may be refined at this stage).

**Prototyping Approaches & Tools**:
- Utilize tools appropriate for the type of prototype: Figma or Adobe XD for digital interfaces, Miro or FigJam for collaborative whiteboarding and service blueprints, Typeform or SurveyMonkey for concept testing surveys, 3D printing for physical objects, or simple mock-ups/storyboards.

**Criteria for a Successful Prototype Stage**:
- The prototype effectively demonstrates the core functionality or addresses the key problem identified.
- It has been tested with representative users or through relevant experiments.
- Positive and actionable feedback has been gathered on usability, functionality, or desirability.
- Key assumptions have been validated or invalidated, leading to clear learnings.

#### Innitiative Validation

Systematically test the prototype or MVP with target users and stakeholders to gather evidence on its effectiveness, desirability, and viability. Capture outcomes, learnings, and make a data-driven decision on whether to proceed, pivot, or halt the innitiative. Use `Innitiative - Validation` to record test results and `Innitiative - Notes` for key insights and decisions.

**Validation Methods**:
- Employ both qualitative methods (e.g., user interviews, usability testing, observation sessions) and quantitative methods (e.g., A/B tests, surveys with larger samples, usage metrics from a pilot) to gather comprehensive feedback.

**Decision Making**:
- Document clear Go/No-Go/Pivot decisions based on the validation results and pre-defined success criteria.
- Record Key Learnings and Insights in `Innitiative - Notes` or a dedicated validation report. These insights are valuable for the current innitiative and future projects.

Update `Innitiative - Phase` to 'Validated' or 'Rejected/Halted'. Ensure `Last Updated` field is current.
