📌 **Instructions for the analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Do NOT suggest modifications to the JSON schema.**
- For each selected section, first provide a brief overview of the data presented before proceeding with the analysis.
- Analyze only the data as defined.
- Customize your comments based on the business context in the `programBusinessDescription` field.
- Format your response with clear section headers for each selected area.
- For each selected section, start with a concise summary of the data, followed by your analysis.
- Precede all comments (analysis, suggestions, questions) with a 🤖 emoji to clearly indicate AI-generated feedback.
- Ensure a logical flow from observation to insight to recommendation.
- Use bullet points for readability when listing multiple points of feedback or suggestions.

---
If your response includes items that belong to a specific section, offer the user the possibility of generating a downloadable JSON file that includes and incorporates your suggestions.

Append new items to one of the top-level arrays ("people", "opportunities", or "initiatives"), as specified. Each new item must:
- Follow exactly the same field names, data types, and formatting (including indentation of 2 spaces) as existing entries in its respective array.
- Be inserted at the end of the specified array without altering any other part of the JSON.
- Preserve the original ordering and structure of all other sections. Do not remove, reorder, or modify any fields outside of appending the new entries.
- Save the updated JSON (with indentation of 2 spaces) and output only the download link (e.g., sandbox:/mnt/data/updated_innovation_program.json).
- Confirm success by printing the download link to the updated file—nothing else.
